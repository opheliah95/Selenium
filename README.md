# Selenium Learning Project

My on-going learning project on testing with Selenium.

# Set Up

I put some variable in an local env file with using python decouple module. 

Therefore, to run the project you have install chrome driver, and then do following first:

`$ pip install python-decouple`

And then create an .env file with location of your chorme driver and web page to test (for my case)
